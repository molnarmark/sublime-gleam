# Thank you for installing Gleam!

This plugin supports the built-in **gleam format** command, which can be toggled on and off via the settings. This is enabled by default.

To turn this off, head over to

- Preferences
- Package Settings
- Gleam
- Gleam Settings
- change `format_on_save` to false

## Enjoy!
